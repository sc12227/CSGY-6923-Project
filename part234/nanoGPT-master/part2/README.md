`part2_ans.csv` contains detailed data and performance metrics for nanoGPT models of various sizes.

`alpha.txt` contains the fitted values.

`draw_cost.py` is used to calculate and compare the training time of nanoGPT models of different sizes. The generated graph is saved as `compute_cost_vs_model_size.png`.

`draw_gpu_usage.py` file contains code to compare GPU usage for different model sizes, and the generated graph is saved as `gpu_memory_estimate_vs_model_size.png`.

`draw_loss.py` file contains code to compare the training losses of different sized nanoGPT models, and the generated image is `training_curves.png`.

`draw_scope.py` file contains code to compare the validation loss of nanoGPT models of different sizes, and the generated image is `scaling_plot_transformer.png`.
